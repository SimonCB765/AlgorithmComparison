		UCLUSTdeficiencycheck - percentage of 'non-redudant' proteins that have an edge that wasn't removed by UCLUST

UCLUST DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------------
say you generate 50 sub-datasets of 1000 proteins from the entire human proteome, and you run the redundancy removal for each sub-dataset at 3 different cut off percentages (let's say 10, 40 and 90)
 The directory structure would look like this
TopLevelDir
 10
 40
 90
in each of the sub-directories you would place one file for each sub-dataset (so 50 in total for this example)
taking 10% cutoff as an example, the files would be placed in the 10 sub-directory. For each of the 50 sub-datasets the file produced by UCLUST which contains the represetnative sequences of the clusters
 (and therefore the sequences which should be non-redudnant) should be put into the sub-directory. For example, the sequences which represent the clusters generated by running UCLUST on sub-dataset 00
at a 10% sequence identitiy cutoff would be placed in sub-directoy 10, those generated by ruinning UCLUST on the dataset at 40% cutoff would be placed in sub-directory 40.
 The naming of the files of representative sequences does not matter. Any name is fine for the individual files.

After running the script the directory is not modified, and the results are put in the file you specifiy when calling the script.

BHOSLIB DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------------
The BHOSLIB directory structure just consists of putting all the BHOSLIB graph files in one directory, and not changing the names.

After running the script the directory will contain the BHOSLIB graph files as before, but also all the results files. These are deleted on every invocation of the script.

PDB DIRECTORY STRUCUTRE
-----------------------------------------------------------
TopLevel
 BLASTDB
 
BLASTDB contains the files with information about similarities, resolutions etc. downloaded from PISCES
 TopLevel contains both teh BLASTDB directory and the gzipped files of the list of non-redundant proteins downloaded from PISCES
